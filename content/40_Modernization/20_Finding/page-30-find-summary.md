So now you can see how easy Redis makes it to implement indexing and querying. Indexing is simply a one-off configuration, and the search language is small but powerful. No more servers to setup, software to download, special search systems to administer. Just continue using Redis. 

Redis makes it simple to supply the fastest indexing and querying experience to your end users, with only minor changes to current applications - they'll love the ease of navigation, and the speed at which they get their answers!
