# Finding What You Want
How many times do you forget the movie, but remember the plot, or something about the plot? How many times do you simply remember some character, or maybe the year of the movie? Or just words in the title, but not the whole title? Wouldn’t it be great if you could comment on a movie and your application would remember those comments and you could search for that movie by comment?

Redis to the rescue! It turns out that Redis has awesome indexing and querying capabilities by way of its RediSearch module. (Don’t let that name fool you! Search is just the smaller half of the story, albeit the most well known! 'RedisIndexingAndQuerying' just doesn’t have the same ring to it!)
