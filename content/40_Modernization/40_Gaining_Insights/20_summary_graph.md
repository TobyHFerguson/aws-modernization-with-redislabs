In this part of the workshop you've had a small taset of using Redis Graph and the associated Cypher graph language. If you have even a passing familiarity with SQL you hopefully have seen how easy it is to construct a query in Cypher which would be far harder to construct in SQL and/or run far more slowly.

Unfortunately as of December 2020 there is no Redis University course for RedisGraph, but there is a great blog post which I thoroughly recommend you read through!
