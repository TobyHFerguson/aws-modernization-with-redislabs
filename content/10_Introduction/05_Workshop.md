# Workshop Introduction
This workshop comprises:

* A pre-built Spring Boot application that is used as the vehicle to demonstrate what is possible using Redis 
* Some hands-on activities with Redis via the [RedisInsight] tool, so you can see what is happening from a Redis perspective and get a little deeper into understanding the underlying data technology. 

Our goal is to get you to _REDIS_-cover Redis: to understand its caching use case and how that has now been greatly extended by Redis' new and powerful capabilities. 

## Who is this workshop for
This workshop is intended for application developers and architects with some command line familiarity to give them some experience about using Redis in an interactive application. From a learning perspective the workshop is both application domain and language neutral: the techniques and examples can be applied to many different application domains and implemented in many different languages. (Of course we had to make concrete choices here and we've chose Movies and Java as our application domain and language, but these are entirely arbitrary.)

## Learning Objectives
Our learning objectives for you are that you'll:

- Understand the basic Redis use case of Caching
- Understand extended use cases involving indexes and querying
- Become familiar with using RedisInsight to interact directly with Redis


It is not our intent to teach your Redis, make you a Redis expert, or cover all of Redis. We don't expect you to be a SpringBoot aficionado or a Java guru. Redis can be used with dozens (60+ at last count) of languages, so you can continue to do what you do well in the language of your choosing. The idea here is to get you excited and interested to learn more about using Redis. For that we recommend [Redis University] - free online courses from the home of Redis

## Prerequisites

If you're reading this online then the only things further we're expecting you to have is an AWS account with sufficient access to create an ECS cluster and an IAM role for that cluster.
